a. Introduction

This analysis will explore the accidental drug related deaths from 2012 through 2018.  I will break down the number of deaths in a variety of ways.

b. The Dataset

The Drug overdose deaths dataset used in my project shows the accidental drug related deaths during 2012-2018 and it was taken from the Kaggle
website.  As per the site it was last updated about 3 years ago.  I chose to analyze this dataset to try and get an understanding of the number
of accidental deaths caused by drug overdoses.

c. Sources

I obtained my data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/drug-overdose-deaths.

d. Summary/Graphs

	Pie Chart - Drug Overdose Deaths by Gender which show 75.1% percent of the deaths are in males and 24.9 for females
	Bar Graph - Drug Overdose Deaths by Age shows that the drug overdoses are the highest in the age range of 30-39
	Bar Graph - Drug Overdose Deaths by Race shows that the drug overdoses are more common in white people
	Bar Graph - Drug Overdose Deaths by State shows that the drug overdoses are more common in CT
	Histogram - Drug Overdose Deaths by Gender
	Scatter Plot - Drug Overdose Deaths by Age

e. Conclusion

In conclusion, the dataset selected appears to show the highest causal factors for drug overdose deaths being white, male, age 30-39, living in CT.  However these results could be due to the sample size of this
particular dataset that I selected to use for this project.  The reason it seems like drug overdoses are more common in white people in the state of CT is because this dataset could have happened to have more
datapoints from these two categories, not necessarily because they're causal factors.
